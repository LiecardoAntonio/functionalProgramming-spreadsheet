  1. You need to be able to match cell ranges in a formula. Cell ranges can look like A1:B12 or A3:A25. You can use a regular expression to match these patterns. Start by declaring a rangeRegex variable and assign it a regular expression that matches A through J (the range of columns in your spreadsheet). Use a capture group with a character class to achieve this. 
  
  2. After matching a cell letter successfully, your rangeRegex needs to match the cell number. Cell numbers in your sheet range from 1 to 99. Add a capture group after your letter capture group. Your new capture group should match one or two digits â€“ the first digit should be 1 through 9, and the second digit should be 0 through 9. The second digit should be optional.

  3. Ranges are separated by a colon. After your two capture groups, your rangeRegex should look for a colon.

  4. After your rangeRegex finds the :, it needs to look for the same letter and number pattern as it did before.

  5. Finally, make your rangeRegex global and case-insensitive.
